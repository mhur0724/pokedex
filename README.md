Hello! This is a Pokedex I made to focus on making a JS project that interacts with an API. I didn't focus too much on the styling of this since I wanted to demonstrate my ability to use JS so it is not responsive and only maintains one size.

The pokedex will provide information (description, stats, and evolution forms) of the specific pokemon requested. It takes either the name or the Id of the pokemon (i.e "Bulbasaur" or "1"). For the most part entering any name should work, but the data from the api can occasionally have extra information ("Zacian-Hero" id:888). However, entering any ID will provide you with the correct pokemon. You can also cycle through the pokemon by clicking the arrow keys on the pokedex or using the arrow keys on your keyboard. 

From this project I was better able to understand how to use Fetch API, axios, and jQuery. Additionally, I learned how to use a debugger as I was just using console.log to try and debug my code, but that quickly became very confusing.

Features: 
Calls to Fetch API.
Dynamically changing stats bars.
Ability to call a pokemon by name or Id.
